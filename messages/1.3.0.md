# GithubEmoji 1.3.0 Changelog

## New Features

* Updated to work with the new Sublime Text 4 completion API

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed extraneous `@` left when using `auto_complete_selector` and `auto_complete_triggers` settings (only in ST4, ST3 API doesn't allow replacing a trigger with another symbol)
* Fixed missing `:` on <kbd>Tab</kbd>-completion in ST4
* Fixed broken <kbd>Tab</kbd>-completion after `@` in ST4

**Note:** If you define `emojiCompletions`/`commitEmojiCompletions` in the GithubEmoji user preferences:

  - and are still using Sublime Text __3__, you need to add `3` to the key name: `emojiCompletions3`/`commitEmojiCompletions3`

  - and upgraded to Sublime Text __4__, you need to __add back__ the first colon `:` to the completion _values_ in `emojiCompletions`, e.g.

    `[":smiley: ðŸ˜ƒ\tsmiling face with open mouth", "smiley:"]` becomes <br/>
    `[":smiley: ðŸ˜ƒ\tsmiling face with open mouth", ":smiley:"]`

    ...and __remove__ the first colon `:` from the completion _values_ in those keys in `commitEmojiCompletions` that don't start with a colon (since the colon will be automatically added by the plugin), e.g.

    `["version tag ðŸ”–\t:bookmark:", ":bookmark:"]` becomes <br/>
    `["version tag ðŸ”–\t:bookmark:", "bookmark:"]`

    but the keys starting with a colon are fine, e.g.

    `[":bookmark: ðŸ”–\tversion tag", ":bookmark:"]` doesn't change

    ...and create a copy of `commitEmojiCompletions` under the name of `commitEmojiCompletionsAuto` and __add__ the first commercial at `@` to the completion _triggers_, e.g.

    `[":bookmark: ðŸ”–\tversion tag", ":bookmark:"]` becomes <br/>
    `["@:bookmark: ðŸ”–\tversion tag", ":bookmark:"]` and

    `["version tag ðŸ”–\t:bookmark:", ":bookmark:"]` becomes <br/>
    `["@version tag ðŸ”–\t:bookmark:", ":bookmark:"]`

    this is needed to make autocompletion triggered via `auto_complete_selector` and `auto_complete_triggers` not leave an extraneous `@`
